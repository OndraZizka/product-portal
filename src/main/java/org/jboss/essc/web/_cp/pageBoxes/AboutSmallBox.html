                        Based on the discussion on The Core, titled <cite>"Why is it so hard to find product builds?"</cite>,
                        the ESSC team decided to make it easier.
                        This site is the result - a site which aggregates semi-automatically key data about the builds,
                        and links to related information or files.
                        <wicket:link><a href="AboutPage.html" class="more">More info here.</a></wicket:link>
                    </p><p>
                        By default, only public releases are shown.
                        If you <wicket:link><a href="LoginPage.html" class="more">register</a></wicket:link>, you can also see internal builds.
                    </p>
